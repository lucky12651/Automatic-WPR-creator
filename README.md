# Weekly Progress Report (WPR) Generator

This Python-based project automates the generation of Weekly Progress Reports (WPRs) using OpenAI's GPT-3, a Word document template, and dynamic date handling. It takes a base content file, processes it with unique content for each week, and outputs a well-structured report in `.docx` format.

## Features

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3 to generate unique content for each section of the report.
- **Dynamic Dates**: Automatically calculates the start and end dates for each week of the WPR.
- **Document Processing**: Loads a `.docx` template, replaces placeholders with generated content, and updates a table with weekly tasks.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a new `.docx` report for each week, based on the base content.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install openai python-docx
```

## Setup

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need to have an OpenAI API key to interact with the GPT-3 model. You can get the key from OpenAI's official website.

2. **Word Template**: The script expects a `.docx` file template (`WPR.docx`) that contains placeholders for the content to be replaced.

3. **Base WPR Content**: Prepare a `.txt` file (`hello.txt`) that contains the base content for the WPR. The content is then used by GPT-3 to generate unique weekly updates.

4. **Configuration**: Modify the script where necessary:
    - `base_wpr_file_path`: Path to your base content `.txt` file.
    - `template_path`: Path to your `.docx` Word template.

## Functions

### `generate_wpr_dates(start_date_str, week_number)`
Generates the start and end dates for a specific week.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `start_date_str`: The start date of the first week in `dd/mm/yyyy` format.
    - `week_number`: The week number (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, etc.).
  
- **Returns**: 
    - `start_date_str`: The start date for the given week.
    - `end_date_str`: The end date for the given week.

### `calculate_remaining_wprs(total_wprs, current_week)`
Calculates the remaining WPRs based on the total number of WPRs and the current week.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `total_wprs`: The total number of WPRs to be generated.
    - `current_week`: The current week number.
  
- **Returns**: 
    - `remaining_wprs`: The number of remaining WPRs.

### `generate_section_content(section_title, base_content, week_number)`
Generates unique content for each section (e.g., "TARGETS SET FOR THE WEEK", "ACHIEVEMENTS FOR THE WEEK", etc.) using GPT-3.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `section_title`: The title of the section for the WPR.
    - `base_content`: The base content from the `.txt` file.
    - `week_number`: The week number for which content needs to be generated.
  
- **Returns**: 
    - The generated content for the section.

### `replace_placeholders(doc, content_replacements)`
Replaces placeholders in the Word template with generated content and adjusts formatting.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `doc`: The Word document object.
    - `content_replacements`: A dictionary of placeholders and their corresponding content.
  
### `update_table_content(doc, table_data)`
Updates the table in the Word document with tasks for each day of the week.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `doc`: The Word document object.
    - `table_data`: A list of lists containing daily tasks.

### `generate_wprs(base_content, template_path, start_week, total_weeks)`
Generates WPRs for the specified range of weeks.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `base_content`: The base content from the `.txt` file.
    - `template_path`: The path to the Word template.
    - `start_week`: The week number to start generating reports from.
    - `total_weeks`: The total number of weeks for which to generate WPRs.

### `read_base_wpr_content(file_path)`
Reads the base content from a `.txt` file.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `file_path`: Path to the `.txt` file.
  
- **Returns**: 
    - The content of the `.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Prepare your base content file (`hello.txt`) and Word template (`WPR.docx`).
2. Set your OpenAI API key in the script.
3. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python generate_wprs.py
```

This will generate weekly reports starting from the specified week and total weeks. The reports will be saved as `WPR_Week_X.docx` files.

## Example Output

```
WPR for Week 4 saved as WPR_Week_4.docx
WPR for Week 5 saved as WPR_Week_5.docx
...
```
